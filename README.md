# instrument-sandbox
This is a testing ground for online instruments, using some of the libraries I've been developing with the support of Blurring the Boundaries Arts / CAMIN over the last year or two.

This repo is a break from the BtB Arts projects for now, as we were developing something of a workflow for the projects, and I wanted to try out some new ideas. I'm trying to get a better handle on these libraries and how they can be used in different contexts.
