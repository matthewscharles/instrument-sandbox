# Instrument Sandbox
This is a testing ground for online instruments, using some of the libraries I've been developing with the support of Blurring the Boundaries Arts / CAMIN over the last year or two.

This repo represents a break from the BtB Arts projects for now, as we were developing something of a soecific workflow for the projects, and I wanted to try out some new ideas.

## Patcher

There are a couple of audio patching demos here - originally developed in vanilla JS, I have been experimenting with D3 and more recently React. React Flow seems to be a good solution, but it's still a bit more work than expected.

I'm trying to get a better handle on these libraries and how they can be used in different contexts.
