# Instrument Sandbox
This is a testing ground for online instruments, using some of the libraries I've been developing with the support of Blurring the Boundaries Arts / CAMIN over the last year or two.

This repo represents a break from the Blurring the Boundaries Arts projects for now, as we were developing something of a soecific workflow for the projects, and I wanted to try out some new ideas.

### Patcher

There are a couple of audio patching demos here - originally developed in vanilla JS, I have been experimenting with D3 and more recently React. 

React Flow seems to be a good solution, but it's still a bit more work than expected.

I'm trying to get a better handle on these libraries and how they can be used in different contexts.


### Usage

Run the build script, then try out the sketches in the sketches folder.

For the React demo, navigate to the patcher subfolder and run dev.

Styles:

```bash
sass --watch ./src/sass/main.scss ./sketches/main.css
```

### Development
- Set window.verbose to "true" to see console messages
